"It shows a crab from the Rust language on top of a black man's head, with short hair resembling Jude Bellingham's. 
The crab is pinching his nose and hanging from his hair. The man in the image fights with the crab, trying to remove its claw from his nose in a comical and gentle manner.
The setting is a podcast, with a microphone on the table and the man wearing headphones. Cartoon style."
